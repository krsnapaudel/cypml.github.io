# Welcome!

Thanks for visiting!

## A Short Bio
* From Nepal
* Graduate of Budhanilkantha School
* BS, MS from Stanford
* Researcher at Wageningen University and Research

## PhD Research
The title of my PhD was: *Machine learning for large-scale crop yield forecasting*.

* [Software implementation](https://github.com/BigDataWUR/MLforCropYieldForecasting)
* [PhD thesis](https://doi.org/10.18174/588095)
* [Sample data](data/DATA.md)

## Postdoc research
I am currently coordinating an effort to create [a benchmark for subnational crop yield forecasting](https://github.com/BigDataWUR/AgML-crop-yield-forecasting). Many researchers from around the world are contributing to this effort. We are all part of the [Machine Learning for Agricultural modeling (AgML)](https://www.agml.org/) team of [Agricultural Model Intercomparison and improvement Project (AgMIP)](https://agmip.org/).
